## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Initially was unsure of the correct syntax for creating a card. I looked back at the pre-work assignment, and based my initial card off of that, modifying to fit this project. After that, main challenge was just the repetition of creating 10 different cards with different photo, title, & description.
